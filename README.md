## About MINI

MINI is a British automotive marque owned by BMW that specializes in small cars. The brand has a rich history dating back to the original Mini designed by Sir Alec Issigonis in 1959.

## Generations

- **Original Mini (1959-2000)**: The iconic small car designed by Sir Alec Issigonis for the British Motor Corporation (BMC). The original Mini revolutionized automotive design with its transverse engine front-wheel-drive layout, allowing for 80% of the car's floorplan to be used for passengers and luggage. The classic Mini remained in production with minimal changes for over 40 years and became a cultural icon.

- **BMW MINI (2001-2006)**: After BMW acquired the brand, the first-generation of the new MINI was introduced. This model was significantly larger than the classic Mini but retained many styling cues from the original. It featured modern technology, improved safety features, and better performance while maintaining the go-kart-like handling characteristics. Available as the MINI One, Cooper, and Cooper S models.

- **Second Generation (2007-2013)**: The second-generation BMW MINI featured an updated design, improved engines including a turbocharged version for the Cooper S, and expanded the range to include the Clubman (estate), Convertible, Countryman (crossover SUV), Coupe, and Roadster variants.

- **Third Generation (2014-2021)**: Built on BMW's UKL platform, this generation featured significantly revised styling, a new family of three and four-cylinder engines, improved efficiency, and advanced technology features. The range continued to expand with the MINI 5-door hatchback joining the lineup.

- **Fourth Generation (2022-present)**: The current generation of MINI features both internal combustion engine models and full electric variants. This generation represents MINI's transition toward electrification while maintaining the brand's distinctive styling and driving characteristics.
